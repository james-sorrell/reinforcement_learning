# Reinforcement Learning

> Introduction

I've written a large amount of Q-Learning based examples in PyTorch
in the atari/pytorch repository.

I have re-written a large number of examples from Lazy Programmers repository, 
specifically RL2 and RL3 into Tensorflow 2. 
https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples

The code in this repository is not perfect, it's for learning purposes
and the goal is not to create production level code.

> Tools

Developed in Python 3.7.6, using Tensorflow 2.2.0,
it has not been tested in environments outside of this.
